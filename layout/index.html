<h2 id="json"><a href="#json">JSON Data</a></h2>

<p>
Click on the following link to view/download the raw JSON data from
which this page is generated:
</p>

<p class="textcenter">
<a href="indiacovid19.json"><strong>indiacovid19.json</strong></a>
</p>

<p>
This JSON file contains a list of list entries. Each inner list entry is
a septuple (7-tuple) consisting of 7 values. Here is an example entry:
</p>

<pre>
<code>[ "2020-03-20", 196, 22, 4, 1, "2020-03-20 17:00",
  "https://web.archive.org/web/20200320173607/https://www.mohfw.gov.in/" ]</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is a description of these 7 values in the order they appear in each
septuple:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Date (in "YYYY-MM-DD" format)</li>
  <li>Number of active cases</li>
  <li>Number of cured cases</li>
  <li>Number of death cases</li>
  <li>Number of migrated cases</li>
  <li>Last updated time as found in the source of the data (in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" format)</li>
  <li>Reference archive link of the source of the data as supporting evidence</li>
</ol>

<p>
If we add the four numbers in an entry for a specific date, we get the
total number of cases for that date.
</p>

<p>
In this page, the sum of the number of cured cases and that of the
migrated cases is reported as the number of cured cases because the
MoHFW website too clubs them together in the statewise status tables.
</p>

<p>

<h2 id="faq"><a href="#faq">Questions and Answers</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li id="faq1">
    <p class="question">
      Why was this project created when other similar projects already
      exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      Different projects have different conventions for reporting the
      numbers. Some projects follow the latest updates appearing in news
      to estimate the case numbers in real time. This project does not
      attempt to provide case numbers in real time. Instead, this
      project is an attempt to document the case numbers from official
      sources only as much as reasonably possible. Further, for each
      entry of case numbers, a reference archive URL is provided that
      points to an archived snapshot of an official source like <a
      href="https://www.mohfw.gov.in/">MoHFW</a> or an unofficial source
      like <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">WoM</a>
      that supports the numbers used in this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a convention, this project attempts to archive the last updated
      case numbers found in an official source for each date.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq2">
    <p class="question">
      Are all case numbers used in this project from official sources
      only?
    </p>
    <p>
      Most numbers used in this project are from an official source like
      <a href="https://www.mohfw.gov.in/">MoHFW</a>. However, for some
      dates, no archived snapshot of the MoHFW website is available. For
      such dates, an unofficial source like <a
      href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">WoM</a> has been
      used.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq3">
    <p class="question">
      Where can I ask more questions or provide feedback about this
      project?
    </p>
    <p>
      To ask questions or provide feedback either
      <a
      href="https://github.com/indiacovid19/indiacovid19/issues">post
      new issues</a> to this project or
